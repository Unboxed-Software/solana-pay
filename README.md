This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

Pages have moved to `app/page.tsx` or `app/[dynamic_route_name]/page.ts` for dynamic routes.

API Routes are now under `app/api`. For instance, `app/api/hello/route.ts` would handle requests to `/api/hello`.

Files in this directory are treated as [API routes]([https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes]) instead of React pages.
